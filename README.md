#Material for learning Japanese with 大地（だいち）

##Purpose
During my studies of the Japanese language, I encountered the need of additional material, which is not only structured by lections, but by categories as verbs, adjectives, interrogation words, etc.. This material was created to support, summarize, and complement.

##Material
The material includes topics of the first lecture book of 大腸:

* adjectives by 「い」 and 「な」
* verbs in dictionary form in classes I, II, and III
* interrogation words
* counters
* grammar with focus on particles
* conjugation

##Format
All notes are intended to be read in the [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a convenient way to write text, which is then afterwards styled by CSS. I use [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com) to display verbs and adjectives with a coustom style sheet, which creates a 'vocabulary card'-like style, which can be found in the folder <code>utilities</code>.


##Disclaimer
I am a student myself. I do not have any expertise in Japanese language and I do not claim any knowlegde what so ever. If you find mistakes, correct them (pull requests). This is what GitHub is about and the reason why I share my efforts in the first place. I am not associated with any company, nor do I pursue any financial interest. Be nice.
